## Screaming

When I say it screams, it actually sends a new message whenever it starts up, and then edits a second "alive" message
 every 30s.

✅ **Started at `2019-08-27T11:04:22.488846`**\
​  📶 Alive at `2019-08-27T11:08:57.073497`
 
These two will allow you to determine the length of any downtime reliably.
Simply find the difference between the timestamp in the last alive message and the next started message.
